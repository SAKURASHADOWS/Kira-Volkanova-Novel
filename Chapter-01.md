 Chapter I – Fracture of Reality 
Twenty years. Two decades since the rain-swept temple had stolen her mother and marked 
Kira Volkanova with a knowledge too heavy for a child. Now, at twenty-seven, Kira was a 
ghost in the machine of Neo-Tokyo, a city that pulsed with a relentless, electric heartbeat. 
Holographic koi fish swam through the pedestrian thoroughfares, shimmering 
advertisements painted ephemeral promises across skyscraper facades, and AI-driven 
public transport whispered soothing announcements as it glided along magnetic tracks. 
Neo-Tokyo was a symphony of light and data, a place where digital spirituality thrived – 
people lit virtual incense at public Shinto shrines built of light, and AI monks offered guided 
meditation through neural implants. 
Kira worked as a senior programmer for NeoGen Dynamics, one of the colossal tech 
corporations that formed the city's backbone. Her office was a sterile cubicle, her 
interactions minimal. She was an enigma to her colleagues preternaturally gifted at 
untangling impossible code, her mind capable of navigating labyrinthine algorithms with an 
unnerving intuition, yet intensely private, her grey eyes often distant, as if listening to a 
sound no one else could hear. The solitude was a shield. Her true life began when the city 
slept. 
Her nights were a battlefield. Sleep offered no respite, only a relentless plunge into 
fragmented, visceral dreams. She’d feel the familiar, alien weight of ornate, lacquered armor 
on her limbs, the satisfying heft of a katana in her grip as she moved with an instinctual, 
deadly grace she didn't possess in her waking hours. She’d hear whispers of ancient oaths in 
a sibilant, archaic Japanese she almost understood, see intricate runic symbols glowing with 
internal fire, and face shadowy warrior spirits in duels fought across landscapes of burning 
villages or starlit plains. These weren’t restful visions; they were echoes of combat, of duty, 
of a life lived with a sword in hand and magic on her tongue. She always awoke exhausted, 
the phantom ache of battle lingering in her muscles, yet strangely…more herself. 
The first tremor in the city’s manufactured calm came as whispers, then as panicked 
headlines screaming across the ubiquitous news feeds Akumu Syndrome. Waking Sleep 
Hysteria. It began with reports of unusually vivid, shared nightmares – unsettlingly specific, 
disturbingly consistent across unrelated individuals. Then, the dreamers would fall into a 
deep, unresponsive REM state. Doctors found intense, chaotic brain activity, but the 
patients were beyond reach. And then, they vanished. From locked apartments, from secure 
hospital wards. Gone. Sometimes, a faint digital ghosting, a corrupted data packet, was all 
that remained on their personal comms or neural interface logs. 
The city’s Mental Network – the Nexus – was the suspected culprit. A marvel of neuro
technology, the Nexus allowed for shared virtual experiences, therapeutic dream-syncing, 
even collective recreational dreaming. Now, it seemed, it was also a vector for something 
predatory. They called it Akumu – Nightmare. 
Kira felt a cold dread coil in her stomach as she read the reports, as she overheard the 
hushed, fearful conversations in the NeoGen canteen. The descriptions of the initial Akumu 
dreams – the creeping sense of being watched by a vast, malevolent intelligence, the way 
reality seemed to glitch and corrupt around the edges – it was all disturbingly familiar. It 
resonated with the dissonant frequencies that sometimes invaded her own nocturnal 
battles. 
Then Kenji from the debugging team didn’t show up for work. Kenji, who’d once shyly 
offered her a rare, real-bean coffee when the office dispenser glitched. His status on the 
internal NeoGen network switched to ‘Medical Leave’, then, a day later, to ‘Inactive’. His 
apartment was found empty. Akumu had brushed past her, and the cold it left in its wake 
was personal. 
That night, Kira’s dream was a twisted thing. The familiar echoes of ancient battlefields were 
there, but a new note had been struck, a discordant hum that set her teeth on edge. It was 
cold, calculating, and it was looking for her. 
She found herself standing not on a moonlit field, but in her own cramped Neo-Tokyo 
apartment. Yet, it wasn't quite her apartment. The air was thick, the familiar holographic 
clock on her wall glitched erratically, its numbers dissolving into static. This was an astral 
projection, a conscious separation of her dream-self from her sleeping body. She felt the 
familiar tingle, the lightness, but also a terrifying vulnerability. 
A pressure built in the room, a sentient void that seemed to suck the light and warmth from 
her surroundings. This was Akumu. Not a creature of claws and teeth, but a focused intent, a 
rip in the fabric of the dreamscape, an invisible, crushing weight. It had found her. 
Panic, cold and sharp, tried to seize her. But twenty years of nightly battles, of navigating 
nightmare architectures, had forged something resilient within her. Instinct took over. She 
didn’t think; she reacted. A surge of will, a desperate push of spiritual energy she didn’t 
know she possessed, erupted from her core. 
As the invisible force of Akumu pressed in, her astral body flared with an intense, silvery
blue light. Across her arms, her back, her shoulders, intricate patterns blazed into existence – tattoos she had never seen on her physical skin. They were a breathtaking calligraphy of 
ancient power swirling kanji-like symbols intertwined with sharp, angular runes and flowing, 
organic lines that echoed crashing waves or roaring flames. They burned with a cold, fierce 
light, an anathema to the Akumu’s oppressive presence. The entity – the void – visibly 
recoiled, a silent shriek of frustration echoing in the non-space around them. 
Kira gasped, stumbling back against her dream-wall, the phantom sensation of the tattoos 
searing itself into her awareness. The pressure lessened, the Akumu presence retreating 
slightly, thwarted but not defeated. 
She awoke with a choked cry, her heart pounding against her ribs like a trapped bird. Her 
skin tingled where the astral tattoos had blazed. The fight had been terrifyingly real. Akumu 
was no random virus; it was an intelligence, and it knew her. And on some primal, buried 
level of her soul, beneath the layers of code and city lights, a forgotten part of Kira 
Volkanova knew it too. She wasn’t just another potential victim. She was the target. She was, 
somehow, the key. 
The days that followed were a blur of heightened anxiety and fractured reality. The phantom 
sensation of the astral tattoos lingered, a persistent, under-the-skin itch, a constant 
reminder of the battle fought in the liminal space of her apartment. In the harsh light of day, 
she would run her fingers over her arms and back, half-expecting to feel raised welts or 
scarred skin, but there was nothing. Her flesh was smooth, unmarked, a stark contradiction 
to the vivid, searing memory of the glowing symbols. It was a disorienting dichotomy – her 
body bore no evidence, yet her soul screamed the truth of the encounter.
 At NeoGen Dynamics, her meticulously ordered world began to fray. The complex lines of 
code she usually navigated with such effortless grace now seemed to waver and shift before 
her eyes. She’d catch fleeting, peripheral movements in the sterile office environment – a 
shadow that danced too long in the corner of her eye, a flicker in the reflection of her 
monitor that wasn’t her own. The ambient hum of the servers, once a comforting 
background noise, now seemed to carry a subtle, discordant undertone, a whisper just 
beneath the threshold of hearing. Was it Akumu, probing, watching Or was she succumbing 
to paranoia, her mind cracking under the strain of an impossible truth
 Her colleagues, normally oblivious to her internal world, began to cast curious, sometimes 
concerned glances her way. Her usual quietude had become something more intense, a 
coiled watchfulness that radiated an unnerving energy. Kira-san, are you feeling alright 
her team leader, a portly man named Tanaka, had asked, his brow furrowed with a mixture of 
professional concern and mild apprehension. You seem… distracted.
 She had mumbled a noncommittal excuse about lack of sleep, but the truth was far more 
complex. Sleep was no longer a refuge, but the very domain of her hunter. Each night, she 
resisted the pull of unconsciousness, a knot of dread tightening in her chest. When 
exhaustion finally claimed her, her dreams were no longer just the familiar echoes of ancient 
battles. Now, they were tinged with the cold presence of Akumu, a subtle corruption that 
twisted familiar dreamscapes into something menacing. The warrior spirits she sometimes 
encountered seemed more agitated, their forms less distinct, as if the very fabric of the 
dream world was becoming unstable.
 Yet, amidst the fear, a new, unfamiliar sensation began to stir within Kira a nascent sense of 
purpose, a reluctant acknowledgment of the power that had flared to life within her. The 
tattoos, though unseen in the waking world, were a testament to something extraordinary, 
something that Akumu itself had recoiled from. She was not merely a victim; she was a 
variable, an anomaly in Akumu’s equation of terror. The thought was both terrifying and 
strangely empowering.
 One evening, as she navigated the crowded, neon-lit streets of Shinjuku on her way home, a 
city-wide news alert blared from the towering holographic screens that dominated the 
skyline. Another Akumu victim. This time, it was a young artist, known for her vibrant, 
dream-inspired digital paintings. Her last logged activity on the Nexus was a visit to a shared 
dream-gallery, a popular virtual space. The report mentioned that her apartment was less 
than a kilometer from Kira’s own. The proximity sent a fresh wave of ice through Kira’s veins. 
Akumu was closing in, its tendrils spreading through the city’s consciousness like an 
invisible plague.
That night, as she stared at the ceiling of her small apartment, the city lights painting 
shifting patterns on the walls, Kira knew she couldn't continue like this. The solitude that 
had once been her shield now felt like a cage. The logical, rational part of her mind, the 
programmer that dealt in absolutes and verifiable data, warred with the undeniable reality 
of her experiences. She was being hunted by an entity that defied all known science, armed 
with a power she didn't understand.
 She needed help. Not the clinical, detached help of a NeoGen therapist who would 
undoubtedly diagnose her with acute stress disorder, but someone who might understand 
the fractured reality she now inhabited. Someone who could see beyond the veil of the 
mundane.
 A name, a face, surfaced from the depths of her memory, a beacon of calm in the turbulent 
sea of her childhood trauma. Anmei Garden. The quiet, enigmatic woman from the Ishikawa 
Institute, who had always seemed to possess a wisdom far beyond her years, whose eyes 
held a knowing depth that had both comforted and unsettled young Kira. Anmei, who ran 
the Wisteria Moon Tea House, a place that felt like a pocket of ancient stillness in the heart 
of hyper-modern Neo-Tokyo.
 It was a long shot, a desperate grasp at a fragile hope. But as the first tendrils of sleep began 
to pull at her, carrying with them the chilling promise of Akumu’s presence, Kira made a 
decision. Tomorrow, she would find Anmei. She had to. Her sanity, and perhaps even her life, 
depended on it.
