Chapter II – Anmei Garden and the Whisperer's Return 
The phantom burn of the astral tattoos lingered on Kira’s skin like an electric hum, a 
constant reminder of the invisible war that had breached the sanctity of her apartment. 
Neo-Tokyo, with its glittering towers and seamless AI integration, felt like a fragile veneer 
stretched taut over a roiling abyss. Kenji’s empty chair at NeoGen was a stark monument to 
the encroaching darkness. Akumu was not just a headline; it was a hunter, and she was its 
designated prey. The knowledge settled in her bones, cold and heavy. 
There was only one person she could think of who might not dismiss her terror as a stress
induced hallucination: Anmei Garden. 
Anmei’s establishment, "The Wisteria Moon Tea House & Antiquities," was an anomaly 
nestled in a quiet, cobbled backstreet, a world away from the chrome and neon arteries of 
Neo-Tokyo. Stepping inside was like stepping into a forgotten era. The air was fragrant with 
the scent of rare teas, aging wood, and subtle, unidentifiable incense. Wind chimes 
whispered melodies from the eaves of the small, meticulously kept garden visible through a 
circular window. Anmei herself, a woman who moved with the serene grace of a water lily, 
seemed as timeless as her shop. She was a few years older than Kira, and they had known 
each other since the Ishikawa Institute, where Anmei’s quiet strength had been a rare solace. 
Kira found Anmei meticulously arranging a display of antique kintsugi pottery, the gold
f
 illed cracks gleaming softly in the filtered light. Anmei looked up as Kira entered, her dark, 
knowing eyes holding a flicker of something that wasn’t surprise, but rather a somber 
expectation. 
“Kira-san,” Anmei said, her voice as smooth and calming as polished river stones. “It has 
been too long. You look… troubled. Please, sit. I will prepare some Sencha Fukamushi. It 
soothes the agitated spirit.” 
As Anmei moved with quiet efficiency, preparing the tea with ritualistic precision, Kira felt 
some of the tension leach from her shoulders. The Wisteria Moon was a sanctuary, a pocket 
of stillness in a city that never slept. When the delicate porcelain cups were filled, releasing 
a grassy, comforting aroma, Kira finally spoke, her voice low and hesitant. She recounted the 
astral attack, the terrifying void of Akumu, and the sudden, blazing appearance of the 
tattoos. She expected disbelief, perhaps gentle concern for her sanity. 
Instead, Anmei listened with an unnerving placidity, her gaze fixed on Kira’s face, her own 
serene, but with an underlying intensity. When Kira finished, the silence stretched, 
punctuated only by the distant hum of the city and the soft clink of Anmei placing her cup 
down. 
“The patterns you describe,” Anmei said finally, her voice soft but firm, “the symbols that 
burned on your astral form… they are not figments of your imagination, Kira. They are 
markers of a lineage, ancient and potent.” 
Kira stared, speechless. 
Anmei continued, “My family, for generations, have been ‘Mamoribito’ – Watchers. We are 
custodians of certain… thresholds. We observe the currents of the spirit world, the echoes 
of past ages that still resonate in the present. I have known, since we were children at the 
Institute, that you were… different. There was an old soul within you, a power dormant but 
undeniable.” 
She paused, her eyes holding Kira’s. “The entity you call Akumu is not new. It is an old wound 
in the fabric of existence, a shadow from a forgotten war. And you, Kira, are intrinsically 
linked to it.” 
Kira felt a chill despite the warm tea. “Linked how? Anmei, what do you know?” 
“I know that your dreams of battle are not mere dreams, but fragmented memories of past 
lives. Your soul is that of a warrior, a priestess of immense power. The tattoos are a 
manifestation of that inherent spiritual energy, a shield and a weapon that awakens in the 
presence of great spiritual threat – or great spiritual connection.” Anmei’s gaze drifted to 
the circular window, towards the tranquil garden. “And I know of the Whisperer.” 
Kira’s breath caught. “You know him?” 
“I know of him,” Anmei corrected gently. “He is a powerful spirit, deeply entwined with your 
soul’s journey. Akumu’s resurgence… it is no coincidence that your awareness of him, and of 
your own abilities, is sharpening now. He may be the only one who can help you understand 
the full extent of what you are facing, and who you truly were.” 
Anmei then gave Kira instructions, not on programming or debugging code, but on how to 
navigate the treacherous pathways of the dreamscape with intent. She spoke of focus, of 
calling out with the spirit, of finding the resonant frequency of a soul one wished to connect 
with. It was a language Kira’s logical mind struggled with, yet her intuition, honed by years of 
nocturnal wanderings, absorbed it eagerly. 
That night, Kira lay in her bed, the city’s neon glow painting faint patterns on her ceiling. 
Instead of passively waiting for the dreams to claim her, she followed Anmei’s guidance. She 
focused her mind, pushing past the anxieties and the digital noise that clung to her waking 
thoughts. She called out, not with her voice, but with a yearning deep within her soul, a 
silent beacon aimed at the memory of the rain-swept temple, at the sorrowful eyes of the 
Whisperer. 
The transition was smoother this time, less a fall and more a conscious stepping-through. 
She found herself standing on the slick, mirrored floor of the ancient temple. The rain still 
fell, a constant, mournful curtain, and the shamisen’s melancholic notes still drifted from 
unseen depths. But this time, she was not a frightened child. She was Kira, the woman, her 
astral tattoos pulsing with a faint, expectant light beneath her dream-skin. 
He was there, on the central dais, as before. The Whisperer. His form was clearer now, less 
ephemeral. He was tall and lean, clad in the dark, flowing robes of an ancient nobleman or 
warrior-poet from a forgotten era of Japan. His handsome face was etched with a profound 
sadness, but his eyes, the color of twilight, held a flicker of recognition, of relief. 
“Kira,” his voice resonated in her mind, no longer just a whisper but a clear, resonant tone, 
like a perfectly struck temple bell. “You have found your way back. The path was always 
there, waiting for your heart to remember.” 
“Who are you?” Kira asked, her voice a mixture of awe and trepidation. “Who am I? Anmei 
said… she said I was a priestess, a warrior.” 
A faint, sad smile touched the Whisperer’s lips. “Anmei speaks the truth. She is a faithful 
guardian of the old ways. You were many things, Kira. In the life that binds us most closely, 
you were Itsuki, the Onmyoji Queen of the Silent Peaks, a mistress of spirits and celestial 
paths, a shield against the shadows that sought to devour the light.” 
Images flooded Kira’s mind, not as dreams, but as vivid, sensory experiences: the crisp air of 
high mountains, the scent of pine and sacred herbs, the weight of ceremonial robes, the 
intricate dance of casting spells with mudras and chanted words that flowed from her lips 
like a forgotten river. She saw herself, stern and beautiful, commanding spirits, her eyes 
blazing with power. 
“And I…” the Whisperer’s form seemed to flicker, a ripple of pain passing through him. “I was 
Kage. A spirit of the ancient forests, a being of twilight and shadow, bound to the natural 
world. Our love was… a song sung against the silence, a light in a gathering storm. 
Forbidden, perhaps, by the rigid laws of men and the jealous whispers of lesser spirits, but 
true.” 
Kira felt an echo of that love, a profound, aching connection that resonated through her 
very essence. It was a love that felt as familiar as her own heartbeat. 
“And Akumu?” she pressed, the name a cold stone in her chest. “Anmei said it was an old 
wound.” 
The light in the Whisperer’s eyes dimmed, replaced by a deep, ancient sorrow. “Akumu… 
Nightmare. He was once known by another name. Raijin. My brother spirit,” he said, the 
words laced with an almost unbearable grief. “Or perhaps, in another echo of the cycle, he 
was your most trusted apprentice, a human boy named Kenzo, who saw your power and 
craved it for himself, who saw our bond and twisted it into a source of bitter resentment.” 
The Whisperer explained that Akumu – Raijin or Kenzo, the core betrayal was the same – had 
been consumed by jealousy and a lust for power. He had sought to usurp Kira’s (Itsuki’s) 
spiritual authority, to control the flow of life and dream. The betrayal had been catastrophic. 
It had led to Itsuki’s death, Kage’s banishment to the liminal spaces between worlds, and the 
unleashing of a wave of spiritual corruption – the first Akumu. 
“What you face now,” Kage continued, his voice heavy, “is his vengeful, fragmented 
consciousness. He has slumbered for centuries, gathering strength in the dark corners of 
the collective unconscious, feeding on fear and despair. The rise of your city’s Nexus, this 
network of minds… it has given him a new pathway, a new means to spread his nightmare 
and to hunt for you.” 
“Why me?” Kira asked, the weight of it all threatening to crush her. “Why is he so obsessed 
with me?” 
“Because you are Itsuki reborn, Kira. You carry the same unique spiritual signature, the 
same potential to wield the light that can unravel his darkness. He seeks to destroy you, to 
extinguish your soul’s flame permanently, to ensure you can never again challenge him. He 
wants to consume all dreamers, to merge their consciousness into a single, unified 
nightmare under his absolute control. Perhaps to achieve a dark godhood, or simply to 
silence the echoes of his own eternal pain.” 
The rain in the dream-temple seemed to intensify, the shamisen’s song becoming a dirge. 
Kira looked at Kage, this spirit of sorrow and love, and saw the reflection of her own 
impossible destiny. She was no longer just Kira Volkanova, programmer. She was a 
reincarnated queen, a lover of a forbidden spirit, and the last line of defense against an 
ancient nightmare that now wore a digital mask. The path ahead was shrouded in shadows, 
but for the first time, she felt a flicker of her ancient power, a warrior’s resolve, stirring 
within her. The fight was just beginning.
