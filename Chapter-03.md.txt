Chapter III – The False City: Neotokyo 
The revelations from Kage—no, Whisperer, as she had first known him—settled over Kira like 
a shroud woven from starlight and sorrow. Itsuki, Onmyoji Queen. Kage, spirit lover. Raijin, 
the betrayer now called Akumu. It was a saga too vast, too mythic for the confines of her 
Neo-Tokyo apartment, for the life of a programmer named Kira Volkanova. Yet, the truth of it 
resonated in the marrow of her bones, in the thrumming energy of her newly awakened 
astral tattoos. 
Armed with this fragmented, terrifying knowledge, Kira knew she couldn't just wait for 
Akumu to make its next move. Anmei, a steadfast anchor in her swirling reality, provided 
practical counsel alongside spiritual wisdom. "Akumu operates through the Nexus, Kira-san," 
Anmei had said, her serene face uncharacteristically grim. "It has woven itself into the city's 
dream-stream. To fight it, you must understand its hunting grounds." 
Kira’s expertise as a programmer, once a mundane skill, now became a crucial weapon. She 
began to trace Akumu’s digital signature, not on the surface networks of NeoGen, but in the 
deeper, murkier undercurrents of the city-wide Nexus. It was like sifting through a polluted 
river, searching for a single, venomous strand of algae. The Akumu code was insidious, 
parasitic, camouflaging itself within corrupted data streams and ghost-ridden subroutines. 
It was creating its own shadow network, a parasitic layer beneath the public dreamscape. 
After days of relentless pursuit, fueled by caffeine and a desperate urgency, she found it: a 
backdoor, a corrupted data stream that pulsed with a familiar, malevolent coldness. It was 
an entry point into Akumu’s domain. Anmei warned her of the dangers. "This is not a 
simulation, Kira. It is a reflection of Akumu's consciousness, a place where its will is law. Be 
cautious." 
That night, Kira didn’t fall into sleep; she dived. Following the pathway she’d uncovered, she 
projected her astral self into the Akumu-infected network. The transition was jarring, like 
being sucked through a corrupted fiber-optic cable. 
She emerged into a chillingly perfect replica of Neo-Tokyo. Every skyscraper, every neon 
sign, every holographic advertisement was meticulously recreated. But it was a city devoid 
of warmth, of life. The angles of the buildings were too sharp, the shadows too deep and 
hungry. The AI inhabitants—the usually cheerful robotic street sweepers, the polite 
holographic guides—were hollow shells, their movements jerky, their synthesized voices flat 
and devoid of inflection, all running on Akumu’s malevolent script. The air hummed with a 
silent, oppressive dread, the psychic residue of countless stolen dreams. This was Neotokyo, 
Akumu’s hunting ground, its simulated city of nightmares. 
A sickening pull drew her towards a distorted version of the NeoGen Dynamics 
headquarters. The gleaming tower, usually a beacon of technological progress, was here a 
dark, monolithic structure that seemed to absorb the faint, sickly light of this dream-forged 
city. Inside, the familiar hum of servers was replaced by a low, guttural whisper that seemed 
to emanate from the walls themselves. 
She found herself in a vast, circular chamber, eerily reminiscent of the central hall in the 
Whisperer’s rain-swept temple, but perverted, twisted. And here, she saw them: dozens of 
versions of herself. Not solid beings, but shimmering, translucent echoes, each trapped in a 
loop of a tragic end. 
One Kira, wreathed in spectral, black flames, screamed silently, her face a mask of agony. 
Another was submerged in an ocean of glitching, corrupted code, her hands outstretched in 
a desperate plea. A third, pale and emaciated, was strapped to a grotesque machine of wires 
and pulsating dark crystals, her spiritual energy visibly siphoning into the device, feeding 
the nightmare city. Each echo was a psychic blow, a horrifying glimpse into Akumu’s 
obsessive cruelty, its myriad ways of destroying her, of using her. These were not just past 
failures; they were warnings, simulations of her potential doom if she faltered. 
The whispers in the room intensified, coalescing into a single, chilling thought that wasn't 
her own: “You see, Reborn One? Every path leads to your unmaking. Every choice, a new 
agony.” 
Akumu knew she was here. The true hunt had begun. 
From the shadows of the chamber, a figure emerged. It was a monk, or what had once been a 
monk. His traditional saffron robes were tattered and stained, interwoven with thick, black 
cables that pulsed with a sickly light. His shaven head was augmented with crude cybernetic 
implants, one eye replaced by a glowing red optic. In his hand, he carried not a simple 
wooden staff, but a metal rod that crackled with corrupted digital energy, its tip sharpened 
to a cruel point. This was a Cyber-Monk, a guardian of some forgotten faith, now possessed, 
twisted, and weaponized by Akumu. 
“The defiler arrives,” the Cyber-Monk rasped, its voice a horrifying blend of synthesized 
static and human suffering. “The anomaly must be purged.” 
The duel was instantaneous. The Monk lunged, his staff crackling, unleashing bolts of dark 
energy that screamed through the air like banshees. Kira’s astral tattoos blazed to life, 
bathing her in their protective silver-blue light. Instinct, honed in countless forgotten lives, 
guided her. She didn’t summon a weapon; she became one. A katana of pure, condensed 
dream-stuff, shimmering like moonlight on water, materialized in her hand. 
They clashed in the heart of the false NeoGen tower, a whirlwind of light and shadow. The 
Cyber-Monk fought with the corrupted mantras of a fallen faith, his words manifesting as 
digital viruses that sought to infect Kira’s astral form, tendrils of dark energy that lashed out 
like whips. Kira moved with the grace of her Onmyoji Queen self, her light-katana deflecting, 
parrying, striking back with focused intent. Each blow against the Monk sent shudders 
through the dreamscape, the walls of the false city flickering like a failing hologram. 
The Monk was relentless, fueled by Akumu’s power and the despair of his own corrupted 
spirit. He tried to trap her in logic loops, whispering insidious doubts, projecting images of 
her mother’s lifeless eyes, of Kenji’s empty apartment. “Your efforts are futile. All dreams 
end. All hope decays.” 
Kira faltered, the psychic assault as potent as any physical blow. But then, the memory of 
Whisperer’s voice, gentle yet strong, echoed in her mind: “You are Itsuki, a shield against 
shadows.” Anmei’s calm face appeared in her thoughts: “This is Akumu’s will, its illusion. 
Your will is stronger.” 
A surge of power, raw and primal, coursed through her. This was not Itsuki’s refined magic, 
nor Kira’s logical code. This was the pure, untamed will of a soul that refused to be 
extinguished. With a cry that was both a challenge and a declaration, she plunged her light
katana not into the Monk, but into the floor of the chamber, into the very foundation of 
Akumu’s false city. 
“This reality is a LIE!” she screamed, channeling all her focus, all her belief, into that single 
point. 
The effect was cataclysmic. The false NeoGen tower shuddered violently. Cracks of pure 
light spread from where her sword was embedded, racing across the floor, up the walls. The 
cityscape visible through the chamber’s vast windows began to glitch and pixelate, 
dissolving like sand. The Cyber-Monk shrieked, its form flickering, its cybernetics sparking as 
its connection to Akumu’s construct was severed. With a final, explosive burst of light, the 
Monk disintegrated into motes of corrupted data. 
The illusion of Neotokyo shattered. The buildings, the streets, the oppressive sky – all 
dissolved. Kira found herself standing not in a city, but in a swirling, chaotic void of raw 
dream-stuff. Colors bled into each other, shapes formed and dissolved, and the air 
thrummed with untamed energy. The rigid structure of Akumu’s simulation was gone, 
replaced by a primal, formless dreamscape where belief was the only currency, and 
willpower was the ultimate weapon. 
She had broken through the veil. The true battleground lay before her. And in the swirling 
chaos, she felt Akumu’s rage, a vast, cold fury, now unmasked and utterly terrifying fury, 
now unmasked and directed solely at her.
 The raw dreamscape was a disorienting maelstrom. Unlike the structured nightmare of 
Neotokyo, this place had no discernible architecture, no up or down, only shifting planes of 
color, sound, and raw emotion. Akumu’s fury was a palpable pressure, a crushing weight that 
sought to extinguish her very consciousness, and the dreamscape itself seemed to react to 
its master's rage. Tendrils of shadow, sharper and more malevolent than any she had faced, 
lashed out from the roiling chaos, while pockets of intense cold or searing heat would form 
and dissipate unpredictably around her. The very air, if it could be called that, vibrated with 
a discordant symphony of fear.
 Suddenly, from the swirling mists of unformed dream-stuff, figures began to coalesce. Not 
one, but dozens, then hundreds. They were faint, translucent, like half-forgotten memories 
given fleeting form. These were the other dreamers, the ones Akumu had ensnared, their 
consciousnesses fragmented and adrift in this chaotic sea. They were The Lost Choir, their 
individual identities subsumed into a collective of fear and confusion. They didn't speak 
with distinct voices, but a cacophony of whispers, sighs, and choked sobs rose from them, a 
symphony of despair that clawed at Kira’s mind. They were drawn to the bright, defiant light 
of her astral tattoos, like moths to a flame, but their proximity was not a comfort.
 Akumu’s influence was strong here. It began to twist the fear of the Lost Choir, amplifying 
their terror and directing it towards Kira. The whispers became accusations, the sorrowful 
sighs turned into chilling condemnations. “She brought this upon us… Her light burns… She 
is the anomaly… Destroy her…” The collective psychic weight of their despair, weaponized by 
Akumu, pressed down on Kira, far more insidious than the Cyber-Monk’s direct attacks. It 
sought to drown her in a sea of guilt and hopelessness.
 Kira gritted her teeth, her light-katana flaring brighter. She couldn't fight these… victims. But 
she couldn’t let their despair, manipulated by Akumu, consume her either. Remembering 
Anmei’s teachings about spiritual shielding, she focused her will, envisioning her astral 
tattoos expanding, creating a shimmering dome of silver-blue light around her. It wasn't an 
aggressive act, but a protective one. The cacophony of the Lost Choir dulled slightly, their 
shadowy forms recoiling from the pure, uncorrupted light. Some of the more coherent 
f
 igures paused, their translucent faces turned towards her with a flicker of something other 
than fear – perhaps confusion, or a dawning, fragile hope.
 As she maintained her shield, another presence made itself known. This was no fragmented 
dreamer, nor a direct minion of Akumu. From the very substance of the dreamscape, a new 
entity began to take shape. It was vast, amorphous, its form constantly shifting, like a cloud 
of sentient stardust or a river of liquid light. It had no discernible features, yet Kira felt an 
ancient, powerful intelligence observing her. This was The Shaper, a native of this raw, 
untamed layer of the dream, an elemental force whose existence was intertwined with the 
very fabric of this realm.
The Shaper communicated not with words, but with direct telepathic impressions, a cascade 
of images and pure concepts flooding Kira’s mind. It was ancient, neutral, its primary 
concern the balance and integrity of its chaotic domain. It perceived Akumu as a blight, a 
corruption that twisted and poisoned the dream-stuff. It also perceived Kira, with her 
burning light and disruptive power, as another potential imbalance. Its initial impression was 
one of wary neutrality, tinged with a potential for hostility if she proved to be as destructive 
as Akumu.
 < Intruder. Disturbance. Why do you burn so bright in the unformed places? > The Shaper’s 
‘voice’ was like the grinding of tectonic plates, the whisper of nebulae.
 Before Kira could formulate a response, Akumu, enraged by her resilience and the failure of 
its psychic assault through the Lost Choir, launched a more direct and terrifying attack. The 
swirling chaos of the dreamscape coalesced, darkening, solidifying into a colossal, 
monstrous form. It was a being of pure nightmare energy, its shape vaguely draconic but 
constantly shifting, with multiple screaming maws, eyes of burning cold, and vast, shadowy 
wings that seemed to absorb all light. This was Akumu’s core manifestation in this realm, a 
stark contrast to the more structured, puppet-like Cyber-Monk. It was a being of raw, 
untamed destructive power.
 The colossal nightmare-entity roared, a sound that tore through the dreamscape, and 
lunged at Kira. She raised her katana, her shield of light flaring, but the sheer force of the 
attack was overwhelming. She was thrown back, her astral form flickering, the voices of the 
Lost Choir screaming in renewed terror.
 As Akumu’s manifestation prepared for another, potentially final blow, something 
unexpected happened. The Shaper, which had been observing impassively, suddenly moved. 
A vast tendril of pure, unformed dream-stuff, shimmering with all the colors of a dying star, 
shot out from its amorphous body and slammed into Akumu’s side. It wasn't a decisive blow, 
but it was enough to throw the nightmare-entity off balance, to momentarily disrupt its 
attack.
 < This blight consumes. It unmakes. The balance is broken too far. > The Shaper’s thought
impression was cold, pragmatic. It wasn't aiding Kira out of altruism, but because Akumu’s 
unchecked power threatened the Shaper’s own existence and the very nature of the raw 
dreamscape it inhabited.
 Kira, stunned but recognizing the momentary reprieve, scrambled to her astral feet. She 
looked towards the Shaper, a silent acknowledgment passing between them – two vastly 
different beings, now temporary, uneasy allies against a common, overwhelming foe. The 
battle for this layer of the dream was far from over, but a new, complex dynamic had just 
been introduced. Akumu was a monstrous threat, but perhaps, just perhaps, Kira was not 
entirely alone in the deepest, most chaotic heart of the nightmare. The fight for the dream 
was becoming a multi-faceted war.
