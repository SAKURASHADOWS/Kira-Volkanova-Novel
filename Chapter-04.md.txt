Chapter IV – The Garden of Sacrifice
 The uneasy alliance with the Shaper was a fragile thing, a momentary congruence of 
purpose in the face of overwhelming destructive force. Akumu’s colossal nightmare 
manifestation, though momentarily staggered by the Shaper’s intervention, was far from 
defeated. It writhed in the chaotic dream-stuff, its multiple maws shrieking a discordant 
chorus of pure rage, its shadowy wings beating against the non-air, stirring cyclones of 
despair and fear that buffeted Kira and even caused ripples across the Shaper’s amorphous 
form. The Lost Choir, caught in this psychic crossfire, wailed in renewed terror, their 
translucent forms flickering like dying embers.
 < The Blight reforms. Its corruption runs deep. It draws power from stolen essence. > The 
Shaper’s telepathic impression was a cold, analytical wave, devoid of emotion but heavy 
with ancient understanding. It conveyed images of Akumu’s tendrils reaching far beyond 
this raw dreamscape, siphoning energy not just from the trapped dreamers of Neo-Tokyo, 
but from something, or someone, much more significant to Kira.
 A sharp, agonizing pang lanced through Kira’s astral self, a feeling of profound connection 
and desperate urgency. It was Whisperer. Kage. Through the swirling chaos, a new vision 
began to impose itself on her senses, overriding the formless maelstrom. It was a place of 
terrifying, corrupted beauty, a vast garden bathed in a perpetual, blood-red twilight. 
Twisted, obsidian trees clawed at a bruised, violet sky, their branches laden with grotesque, 
weeping fruit. Strange, luminous fungi pulsed with a sickly inner light, and the very ground 
seemed to bleed a dark, viscous substance. This was the Red Garden, a place that resonated 
with a deep, forgotten significance in Kira’s soul, a sacred site from Itsuki’s time, now utterly 
defiled.
 And there, in the heart of this nightmarish paradise, she saw him. Whisperer. His spectral 
form, usually so resilient even in its etherealness, was faint, almost transparent, bound to 
the gnarled trunk of a colossal, weeping willow-like tree whose leaves dripped black ichor. 
Tendrils of dark energy, an extension of Akumu’s essence, coiled around him, visibly draining 
his spiritual light, siphoning his very being. He was a prisoner, an anchor, and a power source 
for Akumu’s monstrous form. His eyes, when they briefly met Kira’s across the psychic 
distance, were filled with an unbearable pain, but also an unwavering love and a desperate 
plea – not for himself, but for her to be safe.
 Akumu’s mocking voice, no longer just a disembodied whisper but booming from its 
draconic manifestation, echoed through both the raw dreamscape and the vision of the Red 
Garden. “Behold, Reborn One! Your precious spirit, your forbidden love! So noble, so tragic. 
He fuels my ascendancy. His despair is a sweet nectar.”
 The nightmare-entity in the raw dreamscape began to shift, its form becoming even more 
defined, more powerful, as it visibly drew upon the siphoned energy from the distant, 
trapped Whisperer. The Shaper recoiled slightly, its own form flickering under the intensified 
pressure.
 < Its roots are deep. The stolen essence empowers it beyond this immediate nexus. Sever 
the source, or all dreamscapes will fall to its shadow. > The Shaper’s impression was urgent, 
a rare hint of something akin to concern rippling through its ancient consciousness. It 
showed Kira a complex, interconnected web – Akumu’s core in this raw dreamscape, its 
manifestation in the Red Garden, and its tendrils reaching into the collective unconscious of 
Neo-Tokyo.
 The choice, stark and terrible, crystallized before Kira. Akumu, with its characteristic cruelty, 
made it explicit. “You have a choice, little Onmyoji. Try to sever my connection to the 
dreaming city above, save your precious mortals from their nightmares. Their fear is… 
piquant, but his essence is divine.” The draconic head gestured with a shadowy claw 
towards the vision of the trapped Whisperer. “Or, come to my Red Garden. Try to free him. A 
futile gesture, of course. But think of the poetry! The tragic heroine, sacrificing all for a love 
already lost. Either way, I feast.”
 Kira’s astral heart clenched. To focus her power on shielding Neo-Tokyo, on trying to sever 
Akumu’s primary hold over the city’s dreamers, would mean leaving Whisperer to be 
consumed, his spirit extinguished to fuel Akumu’s monstrous power. But to abandon the 
city, to focus solely on reaching the Red Garden and attempting a rescue, felt like an act of 
unimaginable selfishness, condemning millions to Akumu’s eternal nightmare. The weight of 
both options was crushing. The Lost Choir, sensing her turmoil, their fear amplified by 
Akumu’s taunts, pressed in around her shield, their whispers a chorus of impending doom.
 “Kira-san!”
 A new voice, clear and strong, cut through the psychic cacophony. It was Anmei. Not a 
distant echo, but a focused, powerful projection of her consciousness, a golden light that 
pierced the oppressive gloom of Akumu’s domain. In the Wisteria Moon Tea House, in the 
physical world, Anmei knelt within a protective circle of glowing ofuda talismans, her eyes 
closed in deep concentration, her own spiritual energy blazing as she poured her will across 
the veils between worlds. She had sensed Kira’s desperate predicament, the impossible 
choice laid before her.
 “You do not have to choose between two losses, Kira,” Anmei’s voice resonated, firm and 
reassuring, a balm to Kira’s tormented spirit. “There is always a third path, the path of unity, 
of shared strength. Akumu seeks to divide, to isolate. We must counter it with connection.”
 Anmei began to explain, her thoughts flowing into Kira’s with calm precision, the nature of 
an ancient, perilous rite known only to a few guardian lineages: the Ritual of Soul-Fusion. It 
was a temporary merging of spiritual essences, a way for two or more souls to combine their 
strengths, their knowledge, their willpower, to face a threat that neither could overcome 
alone. The risks were immense – a loss of individual identity, spiritual backlash, even the 
shattering of a soul if the fusion was unstable or the burden too great.
 “I cannot fight Akumu in its full power, nor can I traverse these raw dreamscapes as you do, 
Kira,” Anmei projected. “But I can be your anchor, your conduit. I can lend you my spirit’s 
strength, my lineage’s wisdom. Together, we can forge a weapon that Akumu will not 
anticipate.”
 There was no hesitation in Kira. The trust she had in Anmei was absolute, a bond forged in 
shared trauma and quiet understanding. “Yes,” she projected back, her own will reaching 
out, embracing Anmei’s golden light.
 The fusion was unlike anything Kira had ever experienced. It was not a loss of self, but an 
expansion, an elevation. Her consciousness intertwined with Anmei’s, their memories, their 
strengths, their vulnerabilities merging into a single, luminous whole. She felt Anmei’s 
centuries of accumulated wisdom, the quiet resilience of her Mamoribito lineage, the deep, 
unwavering compassion that was the core of her being. She saw through Anmei’s eyes, felt 
with Anmei’s heart. Simultaneously, Anmei experienced the raw, untamed power of Itsuki 
within Kira, the fierce warrior spirit, the brilliant programmer’s mind, the deep, aching love 
for Kage.
 Their combined astral form began to shift, to solidify. Kira’s silver-blue aura intertwined with 
Anmei’s gold, creating a radiant, opalescent light. Her features softened, yet gained a new, 
formidable intensity. The simple dream-katana in her hand transformed, becoming a 
magnificent tachi, its blade shimmering with intricate, glowing glyphs that were a fusion of 
Itsuki’s Onmyoji symbols and Anmei’s protective wards. A new kind of armor, not physical 
but spiritual, began to coalesce around them – a breathtaking synthesis of ancient samurai 
aesthetics and sleek, futuristic design, its plates glowing with an inner light, deflecting the 
ambient despair of Akumu’s realm. This was no longer just Kira, nor just Itsuki. This was a 
new entity, a fusion of warrior and sage, programmer and priestess.
 < Intriguing. A confluence. Unexpected. > The Shaper’s thought-impression rippled through 
the dreamscape, its amorphous form pulsing with a new level of attention. It did not 
interfere, but observed with its ancient, inscrutable intelligence.
 The fused Kira-Anmei entity turned its combined gaze towards the colossal nightmare 
manifestation of Akumu. Their voice, when it spoke, was a harmonious chord of two souls, 
resonating with power and unwavering resolve.
 “Akumu! Your reign of stolen dreams and manufactured despair ends now. We will not be 
broken by your false choices. We will not yield to your darkness.”
 The battle for the dream, for Whisperer’s soul, and for the fate of Neo-Tokyo, was about to 
enter its most desperate, and perhaps its most spectacular, phase. The Red Garden awaited.
With their declaration echoing through the raw dreamscape, Kira-Anmei focused their 
combined will. The vision of the Red Garden, once a distant, tormenting image, became their 
destination. The chaotic void around them began to warp, to twist, as if reality itself was 
bending to their intent. It was not a physical journey, but a traversal of psychic dimensions, 
a navigation through the corrupted pathways Akumu had woven.
 Akumu’s draconic form roared, attempting to intercept them, lashing out with claws of 
shadow and blasts of nightmare energy. But the Shaper, in its own enigmatic way, 
intervened. Vast walls of unformed dream-stuff rose to block Akumu’s path, shifting and 
reforming, a constantly changing labyrinth that momentarily confused and delayed the 
blight. It wasn't an act of alliance, Kira-Anmei understood, but one of self-preservation on 
the Shaper's part; it was clearing a path for the entity it perceived as the lesser of two 
disruptive forces, or perhaps the one more likely to remove the primary infection.
 *< The path to the heart-rot is open. For now. Do what you must. Restore the flow, or all 
becomes stagnation.> * The Shaper’s final impression was a complex tapestry of warning 
and a strange, almost imperceptible encouragement. Then, its amorphous form seemed to 
recede, to merge back into the background chaos of the raw dreamscape, its immediate role 
played.
 The transition to the Red Garden was sickening, a vertiginous plunge through layers of 
corrupted thought and emotion. They passed through landscapes of pure terror, fields of 
silent, screaming faces, oceans of frozen despair – the psychic detritus of Akumu’s victims. 
But the fused spirit of Kira-Anmei, shielded by their combined light and Anmei’s deep 
spiritual grounding, passed through these horrors without succumbing, their focus locked 
on the image of the trapped Whisperer.
 They emerged, not gradually, but with a jarring suddenness, into the blood-red twilight of 
the Red Garden. The air was thick, cloying, smelling of decay and overripe, grotesque fruit. 
The silence here was different from the chaotic noise of the raw dreamscape; it was a heavy, 
watchful silence, pregnant with malice. The obsidian trees seemed to lean in, their branches 
like skeletal fingers, and the luminous fungi cast eerie, shifting shadows.
 Akumu was here. Not in its colossal draconic form from the deeper void, but in a more 
insidious, pervasive presence. The garden itself felt like an extension of its consciousness. 
And at its heart, bound to the weeping, ichor-dripping willow, Whisperer’s form was even 
fainter than before, his light dimming rapidly.
 “So, the little warrior-priestess and her… companion… have arrived,” Akumu’s voice 
whispered from every shadow, from the rustling of the black leaves, from the very ground 
beneath their feet. It was a sibilant, mocking tone, filled with an arrogant amusement. “Did 
you enjoy the scenic route? I trust the welcoming committee was to your liking.”
 Shadowy figures began to coalesce from the blood-red earth and the trunks of the obsidian 
trees. These were not the lost, fragmented souls of the Choir, but something else: Garden 
Wardens, twisted nature spirits, elementals of the Red Garden that had been corrupted and 
enslaved by Akumu’s influence. They were grotesque parodies of dryads and treants, their 
forms a horrifying fusion of decaying wood, thorny vines, and glowing, malevolent fungi. 
Their eyes were pits of smoldering red light, and they moved with a jerky, unnatural gait, 
armed with claws of sharpened obsidian and whips of thorny, sentient vines.
 “We are here to free Kage,” Kira-Anmei stated, their voice calm but resonant with power, 
their opalescent tachi held ready. “And to end your blight upon this sacred place, Akumu.”
 “Brave words,” Akumu hissed. “But this garden is mine now. Its pain feeds me. Its despair 
strengthens me. And he…” a shadowy tendril snaked out from the weeping willow, caressing 
Whisperer’s fading form, “…he is the choicest bloom. You will join him in my collection.”
 The Garden Wardens attacked, a shambling, screeching horde. The battle in the Red Garden 
began. It was a desperate, claustrophobic fight. The Wardens were numerous, their attacks 
relentless. Kira-Anmei moved as one, their fused form a whirlwind of light and steel. The 
tachi sang, each strike banishing a Warden in a burst of corrupted spiritual energy. Anmei’s 
wisdom guided their movements, allowing them to anticipate attacks, to find weaknesses in 
the Wardens’ defenses. Kira’s warrior instincts and raw power fueled their counter-assaults, 
her Onmyoji knowledge manifesting as bursts of purifying light and protective barriers.
 They fought their way through the corrupted flora, towards the weeping willow at the 
garden’s heart. The ground beneath them was treacherous, sometimes turning to sucking 
mud, sometimes erupting with thorny vines. The air itself seemed to resist them, heavy with 
Akumu’s oppressive will. Each step was a struggle, each defeated Warden replaced by two 
more.
 But the image of Whisperer, fading, suffering, spurred them on. The love that Itsuki had felt 
for Kage, now amplified and shared through the fusion, burned within them, a beacon 
against the encroaching darkness. They were not just fighting for a spirit; they were fighting 
for a love that had defied time, death, and the corruption of worlds. And in the heart of 
Akumu’s blighted garden, that love was their most potent weapon.
